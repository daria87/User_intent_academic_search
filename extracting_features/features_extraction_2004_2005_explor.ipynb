(Initialization): Let $M_T$ memory buffers available. Allocate $M_T$ memory buffers equally among $c_F$ cylinders relation F resides. Denote areas allocated cylinders ${\\\\rm AREA}(i)$, $i=1,\\\\ldots,c_F$. Step 2. (Process F): Read relation F sequentially. every page $p\\\\in F$ following: 1) determine $\\\\alpha(p)$ cylinder page p, 2) create element $ \\\\rho,\\\\alpha(p) $ $\\\\rho$ address page p, move ${\\\\rm AREA}(i)$, 3) ${\\\\rm AREA}(i)$ becomes full, write ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$ free ${\\\\rm AREA}(i)$ incoming elements. Step 3. (F_MAP creation multiple passes): Sort ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$ $\\\\alpha(p)$. standard sorting technique, polyphase external sort merge algorithm [18], used create sorted relations. Concatenate sorted relations ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$, $i=1,\\\\ldots,c_F$, order, single relation. Call resulting relation F_MAP. Stop. size page map absolutely minimal. illustrate follows: Let x bytes required store page address join attribute value, respectively. page map relation F contains $|F|$ entries, entry requiring $(x+y)$ bytes storage. page contains L bytes, number pages page map $\\\\lceil {|F|(x + y)/L}\\\\rceil$. example, L = 1,000 bytes, x = 4 bytes = 8 bytes, conventional systems, page map 1.2 percent size relation. page maps also significantly compact similar indices proposed literature [8], [12], [19], [27], [35]. Consider cost creating page map. Creation temporary unsorted relations ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$, $i=1,\\\\ldots,c_F$, requires $|F|+\\\\lceil {|F|(x + y)/L}\\\\rceil$ page accesses. Given size temporary relations, polyphase external sort merge algorithm requires two read two write operations page sort relations. final concatenation temporary relations create F_MAP requires one read one write operation page. Thus, total cost page map creation $|F|+7\\\\lceil {|F|(x + y)/L}\\\\rceil$ page accesses. consider updating page maps. updates arise updates base relations. update management model base relations may used, updates base relations propagated page maps 1) updates involve creation new pages base relation 2) updates existing page p base relation alters $h(p)$. Otherwise, page maps changed. consider updates terms additions, deletions modifications. Consider addition new tuple base relation. Tuple addition may result creation new page base relation cannot accommodated existing page. Suppose addition tuple results creation new page p. case, new entry $ \\\\alpha(p),\\\\rho $ added page map. exact insertion point easily determined using simple B-tree page map. addition new tuple (or deletion tuple from) existing page effect smallest join attribute value page, page map altered. Otherwise, old entry page map deleted new entry added appropriate location. Thus, update entry page map requires three read/write operations. Note updates R could alter R_MAP updates could alter S_MAP. Consequently, management page map independent other. fact, even one relations reorganized, necessary update page map, leaving page map unaffected. significant advantage state-of-the-art index based join methods [27], [35]. instance, join indices method proposed [35], necessary completely carry join two relations every reorganization point update access path indices used join. Algorithm CREATE_F_MAP assumes priori knowledge join attribute value join involves relation F. unknown F_MAP creation time relation F participates various join operations involve different join attribute values, Step 3 postponed join execution time Step 2 modified follows: Let $\\\\{a_1,\\\\ldots,a\\\\gamma\\\\}$ set attributes relation F constitute potential join attributes. Let $\\\\alpha_1(p),\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha\\\\gamma(p)$ smallest values $\\\\gamma$ potential join attributes page p relation F. Then, entries $ \\\\alpha_1(p),\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha\\\\gamma(p),\\\\rho $ created pages temporary relations ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$, $i=1,\\\\ldots,c_F$. join involves relation F arises, join attribute value known. Step 3 algorithm executed sorting concatenating temporary relations based join attribute. process, remaining $(\\\\gamma -1)$ attributes eliminated create appropriate page map relation F. 4.2 Page Map Creation Intermediate Relation Joins involve two relations typically processed sequence birelational joins [1], [23]. cases, intermediate relations temporarily store results two-way join created later processed relations system. Suppose result join two relations R stored intermediate relation I. page map relation created relations R processed join. joining R S, one memory buffer allocated creation I_MAP, page map relation I. memory buffer designated I_AREA. following algorithm used create I_MAP. Algorithm: CREATE_I_MAP Input: R Step 1. (Process R S; Make entries I_AREA): Process join R write result relation I. page p relation created, following: 1) Create element $ \\\\alpha(p),\\\\rho $ move I_AREA 2) I_AREA becomes full, write elements relation I_TEMP free I_AREA. Step 2. (I_MAP creation): Read relation I_TEMP sort entries, first cylinder address $\\\\alpha(p)$. Write sorted elements I_MAP. Stop. algorithm obviates need scan relation join execution time order create page map. one buffer allocated creation page map, effect join relations R minimal. Furthermore, I_MAP temporary index structure, incur updates.\",\n          \"Performance Measurements section, report practical experiences showing effectivity DAP programs compiled vfcs system vfc [40], successor system vfcs. compilation systems perform source-to-source translation HPF programs explicitly parallel Fortran message passing codes. vfcs provides efficient compilation strategies powerful optimizations regular codes, support irregular codes appropriately. overcome deficiencies, started development vfc, putting main emphasis irregular codes. parallelization strategy compilation systems based upon Single-Program-Multiple-Data (SPMD) paradigm. model, processing node executes (parameterized) code loosely synchronous fashion. generated SPMD programs call MPI routines [13] realize data transfer nodes parallel machine. addition, use numerical experiment ScaLAPACK [3], wide-spread high-performance distributed memory linear algebra package stands Scalable LAPACK [2]. first experiment, investigate potential optimization. measure much costs remap array compared costs iterate array perform stencil operation. computation time high compared communication time, relative performance improvement limited kind optimization. hand, communication time high, considerable performance improvements achieved. measurements give impression fraction time required perform calculations whole arrays time required redistribute whole arrays.

(Initialization): Let $M_T$ memory buffers available. Allocate $M_T$ memory buffers equally among $c_F$ cylinders relation F resides. Denote areas allocated cylinders ${\\\\rm AREA}(i)$, $i=1,\\\\ldots,c_F$. Step 2. (Process F): Read relation F sequentially. every page $p\\\\in F$ following: 1) determine $\\\\alpha(p)$ cylinder page p, 2) create element $ \\\\rho,\\\\alpha(p) $ $\\\\rho$ address page p, move ${\\\\rm AREA}(i)$, 3) ${\\\\rm AREA}(i)$ becomes full, write ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$ free ${\\\\rm AREA}(i)$ incoming elements. Step 3. (F_MAP creation multiple passes): Sort ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$ $\\\\alpha(p)$. standard sorting technique, polyphase external sort merge algorithm [18], used create sorted relations. Concatenate sorted relations ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$, $i=1,\\\\ldots,c_F$, order, single relation. Call resulting relation F_MAP. Stop. size page map absolutely minimal. illustrate follows: Let x bytes required store page address join attribute value, respectively. page map relation F contains $|F|$ entries, entry requiring $(x+y)$ bytes storage. page contains L bytes, number pages page map $\\\\lceil {|F|(x + y)/L}\\\\rceil$. example, L = 1,000 bytes, x = 4 bytes = 8 bytes, conventional systems, page map 1.2 percent size relation. page maps also significantly compact similar indices proposed literature [8], [12], [19], [27], [35]. Consider cost creating page map. Creation temporary unsorted relations ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$, $i=1,\\\\ldots,c_F$, requires $|F|+\\\\lceil {|F|(x + y)/L}\\\\rceil$ page accesses. Given size temporary relations, polyphase external sort merge algorithm requires two read two write operations page sort relations. final concatenation temporary relations create F_MAP requires one read one write operation page. Thus, total cost page map creation $|F|+7\\\\lceil {|F|(x + y)/L}\\\\rceil$ page accesses. consider updating page maps. updates arise updates base relations. update management model base relations may used, updates base relations propagated page maps 1) updates involve creation new pages base relation 2) updates existing page p base relation alters $h(p)$. Otherwise, page maps changed. consider updates terms additions, deletions modifications. Consider addition new tuple base relation. Tuple addition may result creation new page base relation cannot accommodated existing page. Suppose addition tuple results creation new page p. case, new entry $ \\\\alpha(p),\\\\rho $ added page map. exact insertion point easily determined using simple B-tree page map. addition new tuple (or deletion tuple from) existing page effect smallest join attribute value page, page map altered. Otherwise, old entry page map deleted new entry added appropriate location. Thus, update entry page map requires three read/write operations. Note updates R could alter R_MAP updates could alter S_MAP. Consequently, management page map independent other. fact, even one relations reorganized, necessary update page map, leaving page map unaffected. significant advantage state-of-the-art index based join methods [27], [35]. instance, join indices method proposed [35], necessary completely carry join two relations every reorganization point update access path indices used join. Algorithm CREATE_F_MAP assumes priori knowledge join attribute value join involves relation F. unknown F_MAP creation time relation F participates various join operations involve different join attribute values, Step 3 postponed join execution time Step 2 modified follows: Let $\\\\{a_1,\\\\ldots,a\\\\gamma\\\\}$ set attributes relation F constitute potential join attributes. Let $\\\\alpha_1(p),\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha\\\\gamma(p)$ smallest values $\\\\gamma$ potential join attributes page p relation F. Then, entries $ \\\\alpha_1(p),\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha\\\\gamma(p),\\\\rho $ created pages temporary relations ${\\\\rm F\\\\_PASS\\\\_REL}(i)$, $i=1,\\\\ldots,c_F$. join involves relation F arises, join attribute value known. Step 3 algorithm executed sorting concatenating temporary relations based join attribute. process, remaining $(\\\\gamma -1)$ attributes eliminated create appropriate page map relation F. 4.2 Page Map Creation Intermediate Relation Joins involve two relations typically processed sequence birelational joins [1], [23]. cases, intermediate relations temporarily store results two-way join created later processed relations system. Suppose result join two relations R stored intermediate relation I. page map relation created relations R processed join. joining R S, one memory buffer allocated creation I_MAP, page map relation I. memory buffer designated I_AREA. following algorithm used create I_MAP. Algorithm: CREATE_I_MAP Input: R Step 1. (Process R S; Make entries I_AREA): Process join R write result relation I. page p relation created, following: 1) Create element $ \\\\alpha(p),\\\\rho $ move I_AREA 2) I_AREA becomes full, write elements relation I_TEMP free I_AREA. Step 2. (I_MAP creation): Read relation I_TEMP sort entries, first cylinder address $\\\\alpha(p)$. Write sorted elements I_MAP. Stop. algorithm obviates need scan relation join execution time order create page map. one buffer allocated creation page map, effect join relations R minimal. Furthermore, I_MAP temporary index structure, incur updates.\",\n          \"Performance Measurements section, report practical experiences showing effectivity DAP programs compiled vfcs system vfc [40], successor system vfcs. compilation systems perform source-to-source translation HPF programs explicitly parallel Fortran message passing codes. vfcs provides efficient compilation strategies powerful optimizations regular codes, support irregular codes appropriately. overcome deficiencies, started development vfc, putting main emphasis irregular codes. parallelization strategy compilation systems based upon Single-Program-Multiple-Data (SPMD) paradigm. model, processing node executes (parameterized) code loosely synchronous fashion. generated SPMD programs call MPI routines [13] realize data transfer nodes parallel machine. addition, use numerical experiment ScaLAPACK [3], wide-spread high-performance distributed memory linear algebra package stands Scalable LAPACK [2]. first experiment, investigate potential optimization. measure much costs remap array compared costs iterate array perform stencil operation. computation time high compared communication time, relative performance improvement limited kind optimization. hand, communication time high, considerable performance improvements achieved. measurements give impression fraction time required perform calculations whole arrays time required redistribute whole arrays.
